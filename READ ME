# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to play manually by clicking buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Additionally, an **auto-play mode** is included, which repeatedly plays the game every second.

## Features
- **Manual Play:**
  - Click buttons to select **Rock, Paper, or Scissors**.
  - Press keys (`R`, `P`, or `S`) to make a choice.
- **Autoplay Mode:**
  - Toggles on/off with a button.
  - The game runs every second automatically.
- **Score Tracking:**
  - Wins, losses, and ties are stored in **localStorage**.
  - The score persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:**
  - Displays player and computer choices with corresponding emoji images.
  - Shows the updated score after each round.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - `R` â†’ Rock
  - `P` â†’ Paper
  - `S` â†’ Scissors
- **Event Handling:**
  - Uses JavaScript `addEventListener()` to handle button clicks and keyboard inputs.

## How It Works
1. The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors (via buttons or keyboard).
2. The computer randomly picks one of the three choices.
3. The game logic determines the winner based on the standard rules:
   - **Rock beats Scissors**
   - **Scissors beats Paper**
   - **Paper beats Rock**
   - **Same choice results in a Tie**
4. The result is displayed on the screen.
5. The score updates and is saved in `localStorage`.

## Code Breakdown
### 1. **JavaScript Variables**
- `isAutoPlaying`: Boolean variable to check if auto-play mode is active.
- `intervalID`: Stores the interval for auto-play.
- `score`: Stores wins, losses, and ties, retrieved from `localStorage`.

### 2. **Functions**
#### `pickComputerMove()`
- Generates a random number.
- Assigns **Rock, Paper, or Scissors** based on probability.

#### `playGame(player_choice)`
- Determines the winner based on game rules.

#### `autoPlay()`
- Uses `setInterval()` to repeatedly play the game every second.
- Stops autoplay when toggled off with `clearInterval()`.

#### `updateScoreElement()`
- Updates the displayed score in the UI.

### 3. **Event Listeners**
- `click` events for **Rock, Paper, and Scissors** buttons.
- `keydown` events for keyboard shortcuts (`R`, `P`, `S`).
